Dependencies:
  Mandatory: Inherit in the nature of the work (hard logic)
  Discretionary: Discretionary (e.g the order in which components are implemented)
  External: Involve relationships between project and non-project activities (e.g vendoring third party stuff).
  Resource: Multiple projects depend on same resource (e.g only one dev for two projects)

Task Networks:
  Activity on Arrow: Nodes represent Events, edges represents Tasks.
  Activity on Nodes: Nodes represent Tasks, edges represents dependencies Tasks.

CPM (Critical Path Method):
  - A critical path is the series of activities that determines the earliest time by which the project can be completed.

Terms:
  Float (aka Slack): The amount time the activity can actually slip before it changes the critical path.
  Slack: Critical path length - sum(Length of paths that have a delayed node on it)
  Freeslack: The amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting the early start date of subsequent dependent activites.
