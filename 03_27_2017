For a give decision, calculate the possible LOSSES incurred during both a success
AND a failure, add these two numbers together and name it the overall risk exposure.

Requirement 3: Business Value = 70, Cost = 50
Risk 3 = 0.25 chance, costs 40
Add Resources = Reduce risk by 0.1, costs 10

                    0.25    *    40            10
              chance failure   losses
No action                                      +         10
                    0.75    *    0             0
              chance success   losses

                    0.15    *    10 + 40       7.5
              chance failure     losses
Add Resources                                   +         16
                    0.85    *    10            8.5
              chance success   losses
