Example Problem A

  Problem:
    - 20 Miles of sidewalk.
    - Construction Cost: 15k/mile
  Plan:
    -Will take 8 weeks to complete (2.5 miles/wk)

  In Reality:
    - 2 weeks into the project you do a "reality check"
    - You have spent 55k
    - Completed 4 miles of sidewalk (13.75k/mile) (2 miles/wk)

And YOU want to report PERFORMANCE!

Formulae:

  (Formulae make reference to Example Problem A)

  1). BAC (Budgeted at Completion):
    BAC = unitsOfWork * pricePerUnitOfWork
    BAC = 20(miles) * $15k = $300k
    - Total project budget.

  2). PV (Planned Value):
    PV = completed * BAC
    PV = 2/8 * 300 = 75k
    - Planned percentage completed MULTIPLY by BAC
    - How much work in (dollars) should have been completed by this point.
    - Notice how we are using TIME spent as the "completed" variable, and NOT the miles of sidewalk finished.
