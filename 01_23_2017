Example Problem A

  Problem:
    - 20 Miles of sidewalk.
    - Construction Cost: 15k/mile
  Plan:
    -Will take 8 weeks to complete (2.5 miles/wk)

  In Reality:
    - 2 weeks into the project you do a "reality check"
    - You have spent 55k
    - Completed 4 miles of sidewalk (13.75k/mile) (2 miles/wk)

And YOU want to report PERFORMANCE!

Formulae:

  (Formulae will make reference to Example Problem A)

  1). BAC (Budgeted at Completion):
    BAC = unitsOfWork * pricePerUnitOfWork
    BAC = 20(miles) * $15k = $300k
    - Total project budget.

  2). PV (Planned Value) (also known as BCWS, Budgeted Cost of Work Schedule):
    PV = completed * BAC
    PV = 2/8 * $300k = $75k
    - Planned percentage completed MULTIPLY by BAC
    - How much work in (dollars) should have been completed by this point.
    - Notice how we are using TIME spent as the "completed" variable, and NOT the miles of sidewalk finished.
    - "If everything went according to plan, then in two weeks you would have done enough work to award $75k."

  3). EV (Earned Value) (also known as BCWP, Budgeted Cost of Work Performed)
    EV = actualCompletion * BAC
    EV = 4/20 * $300k = $60k
    - ACTUAL earned value.
    - Notice that this one is using the miles of sidewalk completed and NOT the time.
    - Notice how we have earned $60k of value using only $55k.

  4). AC (Actual Cost) (also known as ACWP, Actual Cost of Work Performed):
    AC = sum(costs over a given period of time)
    AC = All of the money spent on a project
    AC = $55k
    - Typically given, I guess. It's just what you spent.

  5). CV (Cost Variance):
    CV = EV - AC
    CV = $60k - $55k = $5k
    - The difference of the expected cost of the project and the actual cost of the project.
    - CV > 0 The project is doing better than expected.
    - CV < 0 The project is doing poorly and costs are running higher than expected.
    - CV = 0 HOW U SO GUD AT PM!?

  6). SV (Schedule Variance):
    SV = EV - PV
    SV = $60k - $75K = -$15k
    -SV > 0 The project is doing better than expected.
    -SV < 0 The project is doing poorly and costs are running higher than expected.
    -SV = 0 HOW U SO GUD AT PM!?

  7). CPI (Cost Performance Index):
    CPI = EV / AC
    CPI = $60k / $55k = 1.09
    CPI > 1 Good Job
    CPI < 1 Bad Job
    CPI = 0 Job
