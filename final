1. Quality/Testing:
  - Different types of testing. Unit, acceptance, alpha, pilot, integration, etc. Check class slides.
    * Unit Testing (not covered)
    * Acceptance Testing
    * Installation Testing
    * Regression Testing
    * Functional (System) Testing
    * Automated Testing
    * Integration Testing
    * Stress Testing
2. CPM, Critical Path Method:
  - Same as the midterm.
  - Again, critical path is the one that is longest.
    I.E. "What is the shortest time to finish" is the longest path on the graph.
3. EVA, Earned Value Analysis:
  - Same as the midterm.
  - There are two types of questions.
      * Computations
      * Just look at the graph (this is what will be on the final!)
4. Risk Management:
  - Just understand that I understand how to do those calculations of the tree
  - See notes from 03_27_2017
