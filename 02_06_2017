More EVM

Reminder:
  BAC = unitsOfWork * pricePerUnitOfWork
  PV = completed * BAC
  EV = actualCompletion * BAC
  AC = sum(costs over a given period of time)
  CV = EV - AC
  SV = EV - PV
  CPI = EV / AC
  SPI = EV / PV

# These values were derived from the week given in class.
AC = 6.0
PV = 3.0
EV = 7.0

Week 3:
  CV = 7.0 - 6.0 = 1.0
  SV = 7.0 - 3.0 = 4.0
  CPI = 7.0 / 6.0 = 1.667
  SPI = 7.0 / 3.0 = 2.333

Week 4:
  CV = 0.75
  SV = 3
  CPI = 1.12
  SPI = 1.75

Week 5:
  CV = -1
  SV = 2
  CPI = 0.875
  SPI = 1.4

Week 6:
  CV = -2.5
  SV = 1.5
  CPI = 0.75
  SPI = 1.25

Dependencies:
  Mandatory: Inherit in the nature of the work (hard logic)
  Discretionary: Discretionary (e.g the order in which components are implemented)
  External: Involve relationships between project and non-project activities (e.g vendoring third party stuff).
  Resource: Multiple projects depend on same resource (e.g only one dev for two projects)

Task Networks:
  Activity on Arrow: Nodes represent Events, edges represents Tasks.
  Activity on Nodes: Nodes represent Tasks, edges represents dependencies Tasks.

CPM (Critical Path Method):
  - A critical path is the series of activities that determines the earliest time by which the project can be completed.
